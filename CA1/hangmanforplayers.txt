How to play hangman:
The rules of the game are really simple, the player needs to guess the randomly chosen word from the gameâ€™s wordlist with a 
set of tries depending on the chosen difficulty, Easy or standard (10 and 5 tries respectively). If the player guesses the 
word correctly, they win the game. Else, they will lose and the answer and the description will be displayed to the player 
regardless if the they win or lose

Main menu looks like this, there are 4 choices in total
[1] Play
[2] Top players
[3] Credits
[0] Exit

Play is to start the game as usual, the sub menu will ask if you want Easy or Standard difficulty in the game
[1] Easy
[2] Standard
[0] Back to main menu

Afterwards it will randomly choose some words and ask you to guess what it is

Top players option will show you the top few users and their high scores

Credits will display the credits page of the hangman project

Exit will end the program
